T:			Welcome to lesson Q1.
 :
 :In the Q series of lessons, we will be learning to touch-type on the standard
 :keyboard.  I will introduce you to each letter on the keyboard, one at a time.
 :By the time you have completed this series, you will be able to type the entire
 :alphabet, the numbers, and most of the punctuation keys by touch.
 :
 :If you have never taken any lessons in typing before, please be patient.  Typing
 :is not difficult but it does take a lot of practice.  Avoid the tendency to
 :look down at your fingers while typing.  This is a very bad habit and is hard
 :to break later.  If you hit the wrong key, I will let you know.  (But, I won't
 :tell anyone else, so don't worry about it.)
 :
 :If you have always used the hunt-and-peck method, you will have an even harder
 :time keeping yourself from looking.  Don't be surprised if you find touch
 :typing slower than your old ways.  It may be slower when you first start.
 :But, touch typing is far faster once you get the hang of it.
 :
 :If you can already touch type, you should be able to go through these lessons
 :fairly quickly.  Or, you may want to go directly to the S series.

 :			The HOME Keys.
 :
 :In order to hit the correct keys by touch alone, you must always know where your
 :fingers are.  The way to do this is to have a special place for each finger.
 :This key is called the HOME position.
 :
 :Place the first finger of your right hand on the J-key.  Now, place your second
 :finger on the K-key, your third finger on the L-key, and your fourth-finger on
 :the ;-key (the one with the : and ; on it).
 :
 :Similarly place the four fingers of your left hand on the F, D, S, and A-keys.
 :Place your right thumb over the SPACE bar.  (Henceforth, always hit the SPACE
 :bar with this thumb.)  Now, lift all your fingers slightly so that they are
 :poised just over the keys.  Each finger should be just barely touching its home
 :key.  This is an electronic keyboard and does not take much pressure to ac-
 :cidentally press the key down.
 :
 :Above the D-key is the E-key.  Above the K-key is the I-key.  Learn these
 :positions well.  Whenever you are about to type a line, look at your fingers and
 :make sure they are in the HOME position.  Then don't look at them again.

 :			DRILL PATTERNS
 :
 :For the rest of this lesson, I will display a line of text in the middle of the
 :screen and instructions at the top of the screen.
 :
 :All you have to do is type in the characters that you see in the middle of
 :the screen.  If you hit the correct key, I will not do anything.  If you make
 :a mistake, I will display a large X under the letter that you got wrong and
 :beep the terminal. In either event, just keep going by typing the next letter.
 :
 :When you have finished typing the line, hit the RETURN key.  To do this, extend
 :the little finger of your right hand over to the RETURN key.  Hit the key and
 :zip the finger back to its home position.  Be careful not to let your other
 :fingers move far from their home positions in the process.  Also, be careful
 :not to type an extra space at the end of the line.
 :
 :If you made no mistakes on the line, I will display the next drill pattern.  If
 :you did make a mistake, I will beep at you and make you do the line again.  If
 :on the second try you made more than two mistakes, I will beep again and make
 :you try again, etc.  Don't forget to use your right thumb for the SPACE bar.

 :drills that you have been doing, I make you keep practicing a line until
 :you get it right.  In a speed exercise, I will only display the text once.
 :
 :What will be different is that I will be timing you.  From the time you type
 :the first letter of the line until you hit the final carriage return, my
 :stopwatch will be running.  When you finish, I will calculate your typing speed
 :and convert it to words per minute (WPM).  I will also count each of the
 :mistakes you make and display the total number of errors.
 :
 :If you make a mistake, I will beep at you and light up the letter that you
 :should have typed in inverse video (a black letter on a white background).
 :Just keep going and try to make as few errors as possible.

 :     How is Dan?  Did he get his job?  Dan had to beg for it
 :if he did.  He is big and fat but not bad.  The boy can do
 :it if he can act to fit his age.  Ask him not to act as a kid.

P:     To attain a personal association with so popular an
 :author is an approved social ambition.  To loan him money or
 :catalog his books we consider a favor.  Today his tailor, later
 :with a coat, loads on him a thousand pardons.  A normal Mon-
 :day program allows a lazy forenoon to ocean and boat; after-
 :noon to various auto roads in orange season; night to play
 :contract or follow the local opera.  As soon as he can account
 :for another book, our author is anxious to go abroad.

 :     "No--why $4?" the station agent* answered (he had won-
 :dered why she was so worried).  But he wasn't to find out--
 :for a white hand pushed back $15 and picked up an old copy
 :of Good Housekeeping from a seat.  She began to read.  When
 :he noted she had chosen "Winter Comfort" he was 100% amused.

T:			Welcome to lesson T1.
 :
 :In the T series of lessons, we will be learning to touch-type on the standard
 :keyboard.  I will introduce you to each letter on the keyboard, one at a time.
 :By the time you have completed this series, you will be able to type the entire
 :alphabet, the numbers, and most of the punctuation keys by touch.
 :
 :If you have never taken any lessons in typing before, please be patient.  Typing
 :is not difficult but it does take a lot of practice.  Avoid the tendency to
 :look down at your fingers while typing.  This is a very bad habit and is hard
 :to break later.  If you hit the wrong key, I will let you know.  (But, I won't
 :tell anyone else, so don't worry about it.)
 :
 :If you have always used the hunt-and-peck method, you will have an even harder
 :time keeping yourself from looking.  Don't be surprised if you find touch
 :typing slower than your old ways.  It may be slower when you first start.
 :But, touch typing is far faster once you get the hang of it.
 :
 :If you can already touch type, you should be able to go through these lessons
 :fairly quickly.  Or, you may want to go directly to the S series.

T:
 :			The HOME Keys.
 :
 :In order to hit the correct keys by touch alone, you must always know where your
 :fingers are.  The way to do this is to have a special place for each finger.
 :This key is called the HOME position.
 :
 :Place the first finger of your right hand on the J-key.  Now, place your second
 :finger on the K-key, your third finger on the L-key, and your fourth-finger on
 :the ;-key (the one with the : and ; on it).
 :
 :Similarly place the four fingers of your left hand on the F, D, S, and A-keys.
 :Place your right thumb over the SPACE bar.  (Henceforth, always hit the SPACE
 :bar with this thumb.)  Now, lift all your fingers slightly so that they are
 :poised just over the keys.  Each finger should be just barely touching its home
 :key.  This is an electronic keyboard and does not take much pressure to ac-
 :cidentally press the key down.
 :
 :Learn these positions well.  Whenever you are about to type a line, look at your
 :fingers and make sure they are in the HOME position.  Then don't look at them
 :again.

T:
 :			DRILL PATTERNS
 :
 :For the rest of this lesson, I will display a line of text in the middle of the
 :screen and instructions at the top of the screen.
 :
 :All you have to do is type in the characters that you see in the middle of
 :the screen.  If you hit the correct key, I will not do anything.  If you make
 :a mistake, I will display a large X under the letter that you got wrong and 
 :beep the terminal. In either event, just keep going by typing the next letter.
 :
 :When you have finished typing the line, hit the RETURN key.  To do this, extend
 :the little finger of your right hand over to the RETURN key.  Hit the key and
 :zip the finger back to its home position.  Be careful not to let your other
 :fingers move far from their home positions in the process.  Also, be careful
 :not to type an extra space at the end of the line.
 :
 :If you made no mistakes on the line, I will display the next drill pattern.  If
 :you did make a mistake, I will beep at you and make you do the line again.  If
 :on the second try you made more than two mistakes, I will beep again and make
 :you try again, etc.  Don't forget to use your right thumb for the SPACE bar.

 :NOTE - not all terminals have the numeric keys in a separate keypad
 :
 :The numeric keys, like all the keys you will be learning from now on, vary
 :somewhat from machine to machine.  The 2 through 0 keys are always in exactly
 :the same place on all typewriter keyboards.  (On keypunch machines and some
 :terminals, however, they are located over the U, I, O, J, K, L, M, comma and
 :period keys.  We will not be concerned with these layouts in this series.)
 :Even if a typewriter or terminal has the standard 2 through 0 keys, it may not
 :have a 1 key.  If it does, the 1 will always be next to the 2.  If it does not,
 :you will have to use the L-key.

 :There are a few keys which we have not studied.  If you decide to touch-type
 :these keys, use the closest finger.  Thus, the ESC, TAB, CAPS LOCK, and SCROLL
 :keys use the A-finger.  And, the keys to the far right (BACKSPACE, DELETE, LINE
 :FEED, RETURN, }, {, etc.) use the ;-finger.  The upper keys (f1, f2, etc.) are
 :not usually touch typed as the reach is too far.  If you can, fine.
 :
 :The CONTROL and REPEAT keys are difficult to touch type, but are treated like
 :the SHIFT keys whenever possible.  For example, to REPEAT an exclamation point,
 :hold the REPEAT key down with your ;-finger and then hit the ! with your A-
 :finger.  Certain command sequences, such as Control/S, are hard to do this way.
 :Many people simply hold the CONTROL-key down with their A-finger and then hit
 :the other key with whatever finger is convenient (usually the F-finger in this
 :case).

P:Strive for typing accuracy.  Speed without accuracy is of little value.
 :Rhythm is the secret of typing skill.  Don't write one part of a word
 :faster than another.  Slow down so that you can maintain a regular rhythm.
 :
 :Think of the letters before you strike them.  Strike the keys evenly, so
 :that the printing impression does not vary.  At the same time, try to
 :develop your stroking speed and make it a habit to release the keys quickly.
 :To get up speed, type each exercise three or four times.
 :
 :To do your best, it is necessary that you be relaxed.  You may be trying so
 :hard that you are all tied up in knots.  Relax consciously.  If you have a
 :feeling of tenseness and hurry, you are not properly relaxed.

T:			Welcome to the Dvorak Course
 :
 :This course has been planned for beginners as well as experienced typists.
 :If you are a beginner learning to type on the American Simplified Keyboard
 :(the Dvorak keyboard), you will find this keyboard easier to learn than
 :the QWERTY (Sholes) keyboard.
 :
 :This is because the ASK has been scientifically designed to minimize cumulative
 :finger motion while typing English.  The ten letters on the Home Row
 :(A, O, E, U, I, D, H, T, N, and S) make up about 70% of all keystrokes.
 :These ten letters alone can form over 3000 words.  Needless to say, having
 :these keys in the home row facilitates both speed and accuracy.
 :
 :If you are already an experienced typist on the Sholes keyboard, don't despair:
 :you won't have to unlearn everything you know.  Your basic typing dexterity
 :remains with you, regardless of the keyboard layout.  Learning the Dvorak
 :keyboard is like learning to "play on a new surface", as a tennis player must
 :learn to adjust to grass court or hard court when she has been accustomed to
 :playing on a clay court.

 :     Why not fly up in the air a half hour or less and
 :look at my lake and our home on the hill?  I left it late
 :last July with one item on my list.  Bill gave me half an
 :hour of help.  Like the lady of the lake I met the king.
 :Bill was a kind king, too.
 :
 :     To lead off into the air and see all our lake so
 :long and lots of land so low, was to live a high hour.  I
 :kept my hand at my ear so as to help hear.  In the air my
 :hair was a loss.  It did not kill me.  I have to fly to know
 :life can be less hard.  I like to hold on and help Bill.  I
 :love to fly.

 :quartet first tried to tell thirty or forty short travel
 :stories.  By turns they transferred to the theater, to art
 :matters, to court trial stories.  In the latter a certain
 :doctor is hurt by a first truck, another truck is struck,
 :and three contractors are thrown to the street.  The girl's
 :strong brother has been hurt.  Further, there are arrests
 :and the sort of extra details that enter into true stories.

P:Dear Fred,
 :
 :     I have dared to ask you for an extra favor on the first.
 :If you are not dated, I am to draft you to drive me by horse
 :or car up the grade to the field house at eight.  I guess you
 :have not heard fully about the great dance to be given by the
 :girls on the floor of the field house.
 :
 :     My hands have put fresh green goods on the walls.  Every
 :girl has a green dress, on its front a funny glass heart that
 :she gives as a favor.  The old folks can drive up early, eat
 :and drink and enjoy it all.  We will delay the dance till the
 :girls enter in a dozen files.  It would crush me to death if
 :an error were found in the plans.  Happy hours on earth are
 :never heavy.  Can you doubt that you are going?
 :
 :Sincerely yours,

P:Dear Madam,
 :
 :     I have your two later notes of March 1.  Maybe it is a
 :large order for you to leave for the north in the month of
 :March.
 :
 :     Our place is miles away, but the real issue is that mu-
 :sic means much to us.  A night of music, even one piece of
 :music, has often meant more to me than my local paper and all
 :the power I have known.  If I can plant a love of music in all
 :parts of this place so that all who hear you sing can learn to
 :love it, it will mean more to me than money.
 :
 :     I never laugh at money, but isn't it plain in these
 :lines that price ought to be the least of all the items?  The
 :point is that our plans for your party are more important.  If
 :you read our other offer in the light of our love for music,
 :we might not seem so far away.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

 :dangerous, or anxious double duty on this survey, write a
 :quotable account yourself for the Journal.

P:Dear Alice,
 :
 :     I shall start my river story since you have shown you like
 :my style.
 :
 :     The scene is a state in the South.  A sweet girl speaks of
 :the sound and sight of the river.  Seven men without shame raise
 :the stock sales and the boy tries to spend too much at the store.
 :In order to make a quiet and quick slide down the river, the men
 :seize the boat while the others, who are quite ready to serve the
 :girl, sleep.
 :
 :     It seems the girl has sense, for on a sheet of paper she
 :writes that her stock of gold is within reach from a round stone
 :under the small shade tree.  She does not quote the boy, but does
 :refer to the sorry end of his short study, and in her reply to his
 :folks she will state how the gold may still be spent in the right
 :way, which will stamp the story as real.

 :
 :     As I watch the wheels of events today, I think you value a
 :thing it has taken me a third of my years to see.  In its total
 :trade the world is one whole, and each part in touch with the
 :other at most times.
 :
 :     The usual farm woman won't see a trade table or understand
 :its terms, for she is tired with her efforts to train and teach
 :her young.  She has tried to throw her value into her home, which
 :to her is worth so much.  War can not be put under until these
 :women see there is but one world, which truly is their world.
 :
 :     Where will you be while the thick wheat is harvested?  If
 :not across the water, would you visit us, using your voice to
 :teach us these things?
 :

P:Dear Annabel,
 :
 :     My brother and his college friends in the factory decided to arrange an
 :evening exactly as in the old days.  After calling us, they arrived and we
 :carried out the idea.  We used an old college catalog and each girl had an
 :old college dress.
 :
 :     Further to advance the evening, my brother advised us of an old address
 :near the freight yard where certain college boys brought this or that article
 :and were allowed a few dollars.  As we went in, an old man came a step farther,
 :fell forward and against me.  Brother charged him.  Will you believe this care-
 :ful account I enclose?  Between brother and me lay this old man who did seem
 :dead.  I can't express my feeling.  His head was covered with marks of blows.
 :

P:Dear Mrs. White,
 :
 :     I have been holding on, but this January I am getting out.
 :My wife herself may have told you of our opening.  However, I go
 :at ten o'clock this morning, and your husband is still out.  He is
 :to do my general work himself, and may not imagine there is any
 :measure of justice in that.  We married men are obliged to do as
 :ordered.
 :
 :     I am leaving a hundred matters.  He has my opinion on each.
 :Tell him the minutes of the last meeting of the members are on my
 :table.  Tell him I haven't an invoice, but have instead an October
 :bill, for our new machine parts.  He may mention this item to the
 :manager, as he has neither its history nor my letters of inquiry.
 :
 :     I find nothing else to include.  We shall miss you greatly,
 :and we shall be looking for you at our new home.

P:Dear Patrick,
 :
 :     I realize that this letter I am sending may subject you to some trouble.
 :I am writing tonight without waiting to go through various reports on our
 :present program.  If I had thought that you would be willing to give me an
 :extra day, perhaps I would have come myself.
 :
 :     As soon as this letter has reached you, and you have finished reading the
 :several items about which I have written, I hope you can give extra working
 :time to my request for special records. These items will suggest a new plan as
 :I picture it.  I shall add them to this note.
 :
 :     It is my purpose to prepare a fast station-to-station service that should
 :be in running order soon.  I suppose it could be started next month.  Let me
 :ask, also, whether we could receipt each payment, as we receive it, on a
 :regular form similar to those in the package shipped you Tuesday.  I am pleased
 :with your showing.  You have been like a soldier on duty in any and all
 :weather.  Success is your teacher.

 :     First, I consider of definite interest anything from
 :the business of as good a customer as you.  As director of
 :our division, I am to continue handling building material.
 :My judgment on all the evidence, which I send herewith
 :enclosed in a second envelope, is one of complete approval.
 :Let me have a contract covering the earliest delivery date.
 :Are you advising me what increase in your discount is to be
 :expected?
 :
 :     Second, this forenoon I saw your son and he told me of
 :his marriage in February.  Although you had not entirely
 :finished the addition to your lake house by last December,
 :couldn't you exchange it, as it is, for my mountain home?
 :Your son said that his young wife wants to live on this
 :mountain to which all your children seem so attached.

P:Dear Nathan,
 :
 :     My last shipment has probably been received, for the purchase was made
 :Thursday.  Tomorrow is Saturday, a pleasant day, for I go on my vacation.
 :
 :     Do you remember an original idea you proposed last November relative
 :to planning for some shipping from my property?  My neighbor recently
 :called it a plan in a thousand, and we must get together so that I can
 :thank you properly.  This is a national as well as personal question,
 :and I am trusting that you will be thinking that it is possible for you to
 :help put it into practice.
 :
 :     If you can possibly separate yourself from teachers and your
 :teaching position sometime soon, plan to get a standard car and
 :whatever else is required for the trip.  The car would also be a
 :pleasure after you return to New York.  May I persuade you in re-

 :so kindly purchased from me in the past.  Rather, as you are
 :returning to this territory by September, our president has re-
 :quested me as secretary to ask that you make a statement before

 :applies.  It is wonderful what our new knowledge has surprised us
 :into regarding as necessary for ourselves--sometimes things not
 :even mentioned yesterday.

 :wise, if you cannot make this provision now, I shall be glad to
 :call upon you later.

 :of its additional study to understand impossible conditions in
 :the poor parts of our city, and its use for adjustment of some
 :particular boy or girl.  Have you read our memorandum in this

P:     The JOURNAL learned that the relatives on their arrival in
 :April had already referred the trouble to lawyers.  Their early re-
 :turn surprises me.  As to the children themselves, the older girls
 :are personally agreeable, slender, and certainly full of zest.  They
 :travel yearly and already are familiar with the world.  Their father
 :was a quizzical old man who fairly idolized them.  His will leaves
 :them very nearly a half-million dollars.  Only the earlier, first
 :will is very irregular.  I've already quizzed them about the real
 :hazards of quarrels over legal prizes of similar size.  From their
 :replies I've realized slowly that the girls are all right.  It
 :really amazes me that even persons like ourselves promptly seize
 :upon some hostile relative's version of an earlier will, which
 :should be recognized easily as false.

T:			SPEED PRACTICE SERIES
 :
 :The S series of lessons is designed to help you improve your typing speed
 :and accuracy.  It is assumed that you have already learned how to touch
 :type either from a previous course in touch typing or from the T series of
 :these lessons.
 :
 :You can use this series even if you do not know how to touch type.  But, it is
 :recommended that you at least learn to touch type most of the letters of the
 :alphabet before starting this series.  When you encounter a letter or symbol
 :which you have not learned, you will have to look.  This is a very bad habit to
 :get into and is hard to break.  (You needn't worry if you only need to glance
 :down for unusual keys, like the dollar sign.)

T:			   RULES OF THE GAME
 :
 :I will display a paragraph on the screen.  You should then type the entire
 :paragraph as quickly and as accurately as possible.   As you type each
 :character, I will immediately check it for accuracy.  If it was right, I won't
 :do anything.  But, if you made a mistake, I will beep and write that letter in
 :inverse video (a black character on a white background).  You can ignore the
 :error and continue going; or, you can backup and correct it with the DELETE
 :or BACKSPACE keys.  (I will still count it as an error though.)
 :
 :I will also be timing you.  From the time you type the first character until
 :you hit the final carriage return, my stop watch will be going.  At the
 :end of the paragraph, I will tell you your rating (in words-per-minute).
 :
 :If you made too many mistakes, try the next paragraph slower.  If you made no
 :mistakes or only one or two, try the next one faster.

 :found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to
 :the ground; and my hair, which was long and thick, tied to the
 :ground in the same manner.  I likewise felt several slender
 :ligatures across my body, from my armpits to my thighs.  I
 :could only look upward; the sun began to grow hot, and the
 :light offended my eyes.  I heard a confused noise about me;
 :but in the posture I lay could see nothing except the sky.  In a
 :little time I felt something alive moving on my left leg,
 :which, advancing gently forward over my breast, came almost up
 :to my chin; when bending my eyes downward as much as I could, I
 :perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high, with a
 :bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his back.  In the
 :mean time I felt at least forty more of the same kind (as I
 :conjectured) following the first.

 :give up their booty in payment of the dead man's debts.

 :That I might touch that cheek!

P:Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
 :I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
 :The evil that men do lives after them;
 :The good is oft interred with their bones;
 :So let it be with Caesar:  The noble Brutus
 :Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
 :If it were so, it was a grievous fault;
 :And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
 :Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,--
 :For Brutus is an honourable man;
 :So are they all, all honourable men,--
 :Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
 :He was my friend, faithful and just to me;
 :But Brutus says he was ambitious;
 :And Brutus is an honourable man.

P:He hath brought many captives home to Rome.
 :Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
 :Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
 :When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
 :Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
 :Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
 :And Brutus is an honourable man.
 :You all did see that on the Lupercal
 :I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
 :Which he did thrice refuse:  was this ambition?
 :Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
 :And, sure, he is an honourable man.

 :What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?

P:The quality of mercy is not strain'd;
 :It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
 :Upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd;
 :It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
 :'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
 :The throned monarch better than his crown;
 :His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
 :The attribute to awe and majesty,
 :Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;

P:But mercy is above this scepter'd sway,--
 :It is enthroned in the heart of kings,
 :It is an attribute to God himself;
 :And earthly power doth then show likest God's
 :When mercy seasons justice.  Therefore, Jew,
 :Though justice be thy plea consider this--
 :That in the course of justice none of us
 :Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
 :And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
 :The deeds of mercy.  I have spoke thus much
 :To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
 :Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
 :Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.

 :			Numeric Keypad Lessons
 :
 :The N series lessons are provided for practice with the numeric keys available
 :on the H89/H19 terminal.  You do not need to know how to touch type on the
 :standard keyboard in order to learn touch typing on a calculator keypad.  So,
 :you can begin this series right away.
 :
 :When entering numeric values, accuracy is usually more important than speed.
 :Take these lessons very slowly.  Speed will come naturally later.
 :
 :As with the standard keypad, you must start in the HOME position.  Place the
 :first three fingers of your right hand over the 4, 5, and 6 keys of the keypad.
 :(Your thumb and fifth finger are not used.)  Your fingers should be poised just
 :over the keys gently brushing them.  Use the thumb or any finger of your left
 :hand for other keys, such as the SPACE bar.
 :
 :After entering each line, hit the ENTER key with the 6-finger (the third finger
 :of your right hand).  Immediately return your finger to the 6 key.  It is very
 :important that you bring the finger back without looking.
